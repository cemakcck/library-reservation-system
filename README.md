# 📚 Library Reservation System – CMPE331 Group Project

This is a full-stack web application developed for the CMPE331 Software Engineering course at Istanbul Bilgi University. The goal was to build a university library reservation platform where students can book time slots at specific libraries, with built-in validation and conflict handling.

> 🧠 This was a group project developed by Cem Akçiçek, Ece Doğa Gül, Berkay Özdelice, Muhammed Ali Akdoğan, and Emirhan İnan.
